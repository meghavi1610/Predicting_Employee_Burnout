# Predicting_Employee_Burnout
This project aims to shed light on the critical issue of the â€œEmployee Burn Rate" and its implications on both employees and organizations.

# Description of Problem
In this project, data associated with employees of a company is analyzed, and predictions over which employees are at a high risk of experiencing 'burnout' were made. The primary objective is to leverage data-driven insights from the dataset, which includes various factors that may contribute to burnout, such as resource allocation, mental fatigue rate, and WFH setup. This project will enable us to identify individuals who may be at risk of burnout before it becomes a critical issue.
